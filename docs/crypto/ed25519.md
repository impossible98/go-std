# ed25519

```go
import "crypto/ed25519"
```

## Overview

This package implements the Ed25519 signature algorithm. See https://ed25519.cr.yp.to/.

These functions are also compatible with the “Ed25519” function defined in [RFC 8032](https://rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8032.html). However, unlike [RFC 8032](https://rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8032.html)'s formulation, this package's private key representation includes a public key suffix to make multiple signing operations with the same key more efficient. This package refers to the [RFC 8032](https://rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8032.html) private key as the “seed”.

## Constants

```go
const (
	// PublicKeySize is the size, in bytes, of public keys as used in this package.
	PublicKeySize = 32
	// PrivateKeySize is the size, in bytes, of private keys as used in this package.
	PrivateKeySize = 64
	// SignatureSize is the size, in bytes, of signatures generated and verified by this package.
	SignatureSize = 64
	// SeedSize is the size, in bytes, of private key seeds. These are the private key representations used by RFC 8032.
	SeedSize = 32
)
```

## Functions

### GenerateKey

```go
func GenerateKey(rand io.Reader) (PublicKey, PrivateKey, error)
```

GenerateKey generates a public/private key pair using entropy from rand. If rand is nil, crypto/rand.Reader will be used.

### Sign

```go
func Sign(privateKey PrivateKey, message []byte) []byte
```

Sign signs the message with privateKey and returns a signature. It will panic if len(privateKey) is not PrivateKeySize.

### Verify

```go
func Verify(publicKey PublicKey, message, sig []byte) bool
```

Verify reports whether sig is a valid signature of message by publicKey. It will panic if len(publicKey) is not PublicKeySize.

## Types

### PrivateKey

```go
type PrivateKey []byte
```

PrivateKey is the type of Ed25519 private keys. It implements crypto.Signer.

#### NewKeyFromSeed

```go
func NewKeyFromSeed(seed []byte) PrivateKey
```

NewKeyFromSeed calculates a private key from a seed. It will panic if len(seed) is not SeedSize. This function is provided for interoperability with [RFC 8032](https://rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8032.html). [RFC 8032](https://rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8032.html)'s private keys correspond to seeds in this package.

#### (PrivateKey) Equal

```go
func (priv PrivateKey) Equal(x crypto.PrivateKey) bool
```

Equal reports whether priv and x have the same value.

#### (PrivateKey) Public

```go
func (priv PrivateKey) Public() crypto.PublicKey
```

Public returns the PublicKey corresponding to priv.

#### (PrivateKey) Seed

```go
func (priv PrivateKey) Seed() []byte
```

Seed returns the private key seed corresponding to priv. It is provided for interoperability with [RFC 8032](https://rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8032.html). [RFC 8032](https://rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8032.html)'s private keys correspond to seeds in this package.

#### (PrivateKey) Sign

```go
func (priv PrivateKey) Sign(rand io.Reader, message []byte, opts crypto.SignerOpts) (signature []byte, err error)
```

Sign signs the given message with priv. Ed25519 performs two passes over messages to be signed and therefore cannot handle pre-hashed messages. Thus opts.HashFunc() must return zero to indicate the message hasn't been hashed. This can be achieved by passing crypto.Hash(0) as the value for opts.

### PublicKey

```go
type PublicKey []byte
```

PublicKey is the type of Ed25519 public keys.

#### (PublicKey) Equal

```go
func (pub PublicKey) Equal(x crypto.PublicKey) bool
```

Equal reports whether pub and x have the same value.
